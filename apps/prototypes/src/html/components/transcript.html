            <p>You’re free to live, work and travel across 27 countries in the world’s biggest single market. The EU fights for fairness, acting to tackle the energy crisis and ensure adequate minimum wages. It protects us as citizens and consumers: making sure our food is safe, our air is clean and our online environment secure.

The EU is a global power: supporting democracy, protecting the environment, securing trade deals, promoting peace, progress and security. Democracy in action European Parliament
