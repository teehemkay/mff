    <p>The EU long-term budget is also known as the Multiannual Financial
    Framework (MFF). It is an investment budget that sets the maximum amount of
    money that can be invested in each policy area. The annual EU budgets, as
    well as EU spending on programmes and policies, must respect these
    ceilings.</p>

    <p>It is based on a proposal by the European Commission and has to be
    adopted unanimously by the Council, which represents EU governments. Before
    that, it has to receive the consent of the European Parliament by an
    absolute majority of all its Members.</p>
  - >
    <p>The current long-term budget runs from 2021 to 2027. This means that the
    next budget will need to be agreed by the end of 2027 to come into effect on
    1 January 2028.</p>
  - >
    <p>It is primarily an investment budget, focusing on tackling common
    challenges and delivering on agreed priorities, such as:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>strengthening the economy, creating jobs and supporting research and
    investment</li>

    <li>tackling climate change, and protecting the environment</li>

    <li>strengthening external borders and improving European security</li>

    <li>supporting workers and social rights</li>

    <li>supporting Europe’s regions, for economic and social cohesion and
    cross-border cooperation </li>

    <li>supporting agriculture and ensuring food security</li>

    </ul>

    <p>More than 93% of the EU budget funds activities that make a difference in
    the EU countries and beyond. It benefits citizens, regions, cities, farmers,
    researchers, students, civil society and businesses.</p>

    <p>The EU&#39;s administrative expenditure accounts for less than 7% of the
    total EU budget. This allows for the EU institutions to function, prepare
    and take decisions in the common interest.</p>
  - >
    <p>Here are some examples of who and what the EU budget supports:</p>

    <p><strong>Small businesses</strong>: small and medium-sized enterprises are
    the backbone of the EU’s economy. Different EU programmes support them in
    expanding, innovating and competing on a global scale. This funding helps
    boost employment and drive economic growth at local level and in the EU as a
    whole.</p>

    <p><strong>Farmers and rural communities</strong>: to ensure food security,
    maintain sustainable agriculture, and support rural development.</p>

    <p><strong>Students and educational institutions</strong>: programmes like
    Erasmus+ offer students opportunities to study abroad, enhance cultural
    exchange and educational experiences. This funding supports universities and
    vocational training centres, to support an adaptable and skilled
    workforce.</p>

    <p><strong>Research and innovation</strong>: Horizon Europe, the EU’s
    flagship research and innovation programme, invests in groundbreaking
    research and technological advancements. It supports scientists and
    start-ups that drive innovation in fields such as health, digital
    technology, renewable energy, and many other areas.</p>

    <p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: the EU invests in infrastructure
    development to improve transportation networks, develop energy efficiency
    and energy independence and digital connectivity. These projects create jobs
    and support regional development.</p>

    <p><strong>Cultural and creative sectors</strong>: the Creative Europe
    programme supports artists, cultural organisations, and media outlets,
    promoting cultural diversity and helping creative industries thrive in a
    competitive market.</p>

    <p><strong>Tackling climate change and protecting our environment</strong>:
    the EU funds programmes and projects aimed at addressing climate change,
    preserving biodiversity, and promoting sustainable practices.</p>

    <p><strong>Public health and preparedness</strong>: the EU invests in health
    initiatives and crisis response mechanisms, including public health
    infrastructure, to strengthen our preparedness against future possible
    pandemics, natural disasters and other emergencies.</p>

    <p><strong>Strengthening Europe’s regions</strong>: the EU budget supports
    economic and social cohesion by funding projects that reduce disparities
    between regions. It invests in infrastructure, education, and job creation
    to boost development in less prosperous areas. This helps promote balanced
    growth and improves living standards across the EU.</p>
  - >
    <p>Compared to national budgets, the EU budget has limited flexibility in
    how the funds can be spent. It also differs from national budgets as it
    cannot run a deficit.</p>

    <p>The budgets also cover different areas. Unlike national budgets, which
    are used in large part for providing public services and funding social
    security systems, the EU budget is mainly an investment budget with a focus
    on measures that benefit Europeans.</p>
  - |
    <p>The EU budget is relatively small compared to national budgets. It accounts annually for around <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.eca.europa.eu/en/the-eu-finances">1% of the EU&#39;s GNI (gross national income)</a>, or around €160-180 billion. National public spending by EU countries averages nearly 50% of their respective GNI.</p>
    <p>Under the current EU long-term budget, the EU can commit to spending €1,074 billion (in 2018 prices) between 2021 and 2027.</p>
    <p>The budget serves 450 million inhabitants, and represents a small proportion of overall public spending in the EU. As an example, it is smaller than the national budget of Austria (9 million inhabitants): for the year 2022, the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/annual-eu-budget/all-annual-budgets/2022_en">EU budget was approximately €170 billion</a> , and the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/gov_10a_exp__custom_13928345/default/table?lang=en">national Austrian budget was approximately €240 billion</a> .</p>
  - |
    <p>Another difference between the EU budget and national budgets is that the EU lacks direct taxation power to finance its budget and instead relies on revenues called “own resources”.</p>
    <p>These revenues are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Custom duties on imports into the EU</li>
    <li>A small part of the VAT collected by each EU country</li>
    <li>A contribution based on the amount of non-recycled plastic waste in each EU country </li>
    <li>National contribution from each EU country based on its gross national income (GNI). All member states contribute according to their share in the combined GNI of EU countries. This is the largest share of the own resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> MEPs have consistently argued that the EU budget needs new <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20221110STO53101/parliament-wants-new-sources-of-revenue-for-the-eu">sources of revenue</a>, so that it has reliable long-term funding.</p>
  - |
    <p>Yes, to receive EU funds, recipients need to respect the EU’s fundamental values enshrined in <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/146/the-protection-of-article-2-teu-values-in-the-eu">Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union</a>: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.</p>
    <p>The Rule of Law Conditionality Regulation makes it possible to suspend payments from the EU budget if the principles of the rule of law are violated. It ensures that money is well spent and that common rules and principles are upheld at all times. There can be no EU funding without respect for EU values.</p>
    <p>At Parliament’s insistence, the conditionality regulation was adopted as part of the EU long-term budget 2021-2027 and the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://next-generation-eu.europa.eu/index_en">Next Generation EU recovery package</a>. </p>
  - >
    <p>Initially, the European Union (then the European Communities) was mainly
    financed through direct contributions from member states.</p>

    <p>In 1970 the system of “own resources” was introduced, which meant that
    there was an automatic stream of revenue to the then European
    Communities.</p>

    <p>The idea of a long-term budget spanning several years developed in the
    1980s as a way to harmonise the work of the EU institutions and strengthen
    budgetary discipline. The first long-term budget was adopted in 1988.</p>

    <p>There have been six EU long-term budgets to date. The sixth and current
    one covers the period 2021-2027 and will run until 31 December 2027. The
    next one will come into force on 1 January 2028 and will likely run until
    2034.</p>
