  <p>Parliament establishes its priorities on the next long-term EU budget in a
  report to be adopted in plenary in May 2025. Here are some of the key issues
  that the next budget will have to tackle.</p>
pageContent: >
  <p>Amid global political shifts, Europe will need to have the means to do
  more, and deliver on citizens’ expectations.</p>

  <p>The EU budget will have to provide financial support to make Europe more
  competitive and capable to defend itself. At the same time, support for
  farmers and cohesion policy, that helps overcome inequalities between
  countries and regions within a country, should continue to play an important
  role.</p>

  <p>Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine means that resources are needed
  for financial, military and humanitarian support to Ukraine, as well as for
  boosting defence cooperation.</p>

  <p>Greater transparency requires accountability and Parliament needs to
  maintain its democratic oversight as a budgetary authority. </p>

  <p>Beneficiaries should have easier access to funds. Simplification of the
  budget aims to reduce bureaucracy and increase transparency so that the budget
  can ensure better outcomes for final beneficiaries like small businesses,
  farmers and civil society organisations, finance a competitive economy and
  support the EU’s economic and social model.</p>

  <p>The next EU long-term budget must be flexible enough to respond to
  unforeseen crises and adapt to evolving needs. </p>

  <p>The EU budget must uphold European values by maintaining strict rule of law
  conditionality for member states.</p>

  <p>Repayment of loans taken to help Europe recover from the Covid-19 pandemic
  should not be at the detriment of existing EU funding programmes, which should
  be safeguarded. </p>
