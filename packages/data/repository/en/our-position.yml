  <p>Parliament establishes its priorities and position on the next long-term EU
  budget in a report to be adopted in plenary in May 2025. Here are some of the
  key issues that the next budget will have to tackle.</p>
pageContent: >
  <p>Amid global political shifts, Europe will need to have the means to do
  more, and deliver on citizens’ expectations.</p>

  <p>Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine means that resources are needed
  for financial, military and humanitarian support to Ukraine, as well as for
  boosting defence cooperation.</p>

  <p>In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, the EU exceptionally borrowed
  funds to invest in post-pandemic recovery. Interest rates have since risen,
  meaning that servicing the debt has become more expensive.</p>

  <p>Repayment of loans under the Next Generation EU recovery plan should not be
  at the detriment of existing EU funding programmes, which should be
  safeguarded. Europe needs new resources for old debt.</p>

  <p>The budget’s value increases by 2% per year to compensate for inflation -
  but for several years inflation has been considerably higher than that. This
  means that, in real terms, the budget has shrunk.</p>

  <p>Beneficiaries should have easier access to funds. Simplification of the
  budget aims to reduce bureaucracy and increase transparency so that the budget
  can ensure better outcomes for final beneficiaries like small businesses,
  farmers and civil society organisations, finance a competitive economy and
  support the EU’s economic and social model.</p>

  <p>The EU budget must uphold European values by maintaining strict rule of law
  conditionality for member states.</p>

  <p>The next EU long-term budget must be flexible enough to respond to
  unforeseen crises and adapt to evolving needs. </p>

  <p>Greater transparency requires accountability and Parliament needs to
  maintain its democratic oversight as a budgetary authority. </p>

  <p>Agriculture and cohesion policies should continue to play a role in the
  future and increased funding for security, defence, and cybersecurity is
  crucial to counter global instability. </p>
