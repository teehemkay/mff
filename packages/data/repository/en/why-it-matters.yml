  <p>Europe faces challenges that can only be tackled together. The European
  Parliament is working to make sure the EU long-term budget invests in what
  matters to Europeans.</p>

  <p>The EU long-term budget provides financing to ensure that the EU has the
  means to deliver on its objectives: safeguarding peace and bringing prosperity
  across Europe.</p>

  <p>Europe&#39;s common challenges can be better tackled together. The EU
  long-term budget provides European added value by pooling resources, which
  means funding projects and policies where it makes more sense to spend
  together rather than separately.</p>

  <p>Over the last few years, the political, economic and social context has
  changed significantly. Today, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, as well as
  the need for the EU to stay competitive, support businesses in the digital
  transformation and tackle climate change pose major challenges to Europe’s
  security and economy.</p>

  <p>Now it is time for the EU to decide on a long-term budget that will support
  the Union’s economy and societies from 2028 onwards. The context remains
  extremely challenging. There are some stark <strong>realities we can’t
  ignore</strong> - such as the war in Ukraine, the high cost of living, the
  need to boost our security and competitiveness, and tackle climate change.
  Europe needs to <strong>invest in what matters</strong>.</p>

  surveys show</a>  that Europeans expect clear EU action in several key areas:
  economy and social issues, defence and security, climate change, and
  agriculture. </p>

  <p>The European Parliament is working together with the other EU institutions
  to address these expectations and set up the next long-term budget.</p>
