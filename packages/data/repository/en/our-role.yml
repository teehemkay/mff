faqAnswer:
  - >
    <p>Parliament plays an important role with regard to the EU long-term
    budget: it has to give its consent to the long-term budgetary framework, and
    decides jointly with the Council on the annual budget. As the EU’s
    democratically elected body, Parliament has the responsibility to approve,
    monitor and scrutinise the EU budget.</p>

    <p>The Commission proposes the draft budget. The Council, representing the
    EU governments, and the European Parliament, representing EU citizens,  hold
    negotiations to find agreement on it.</p>

    <p>Discussions on the next EU long-term budget have already started.
    Negotiations between the Council, Parliament and the Commission will begin
    once the Commission has presented the proposal for the next long-term
    budget. This is expected in July 2025.</p>

    <p>In anticipation of the Commission proposal, Parliament adopts its
    priorities and input in an “own initiative report”.</p>

    <p>This report is drawn up in the Budget Committee of the Parliament, where
    MEPs from all political groups discuss, negotiate and vote on the report. It
    is then voted on by the whole Parliament in a plenary session. This vote in
    plenary is expected in May 2025.</p>

    <p>Once the Commission’s proposal is made, Parliament will prepare its
    position for negotiations with the Council and Commission to reach an
    agreement on the priorities, structure and size of the next EU long-term
    budget. Throughout the process, Parliament, as directly-elected legislator,
    is actively involved in negotiations, adoption, and implementation of the
    budget.</p>

    <p>At the end of the negotiation process, Parliament cannot make amendments
    to the final proposal, but will be required to give its consent through a
    plenary vote. This consent has to be given by an absolute majority of all
    members of the European Parliament.</p>

    <p>The European Parliament’s co-rapporteurs for the next EU long-term budget are Siegfried Mureşan (Romania) from the European People&#39;s Party group, and Carla Tavares (Portugal) from the Socialists and Democrats group.</p>

Another key position is held by the chair of the Committee on Budgets, Johan Van Overtveldt, a Belgian member from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group.</p>
